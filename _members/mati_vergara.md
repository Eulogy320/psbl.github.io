Bioinformatician specialized in single-cell data analysis and functional genomics, with strong experience in RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and multi-omics integration. My work focuses on extracting biologically meaningful patterns from high-dimensional data by combining statistical modeling, machine learning, and reproducible computational pipelines. I have experience in both plant and human genomics, including genome assembly, epigenomics, and cancer-related datasets.
