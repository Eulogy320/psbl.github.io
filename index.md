# Plant system Biology Lab at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile 

Our main goal is to understand how plants sense and respond to nutrients. And in particular, how nutrient signals interact with other signaling pathways to coordinate global gene expression in plants.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our laboratory integrates experimental plant biology, computational modeling, and systems-level analysis to understand how plants perceive and respond to environmental signals. By combining molecular genetics, quantitative approaches, and theoretical frameworks, we aim to uncover regulatory mechanisms that control growth, adaptation, and resilience, generating knowledge with relevance for both fundamental science and sustainable agriculture..

{% capture text %}

Our projects address fundamental and applied questions in plant and ecosystem biology, with a focus on growth regulation, environmental adaptation, and resilience to biotic and abiotic stress. By combining molecular genetics, quantitative modeling, synthetic biology, and data-driven approaches, we generate predictive frameworks and actionable knowledge relevant to sustainable agriculture and environmental management.
