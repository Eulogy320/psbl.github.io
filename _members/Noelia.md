I am an Associate Researcher at CONICET and a member of the Molecular and Integrative Physiology Group at IIB–UNMdP (Argentina), where I work on the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant and algal physiology. I obtained my PhD in Biological Sciences (summa cum laude) at the National University of Mar del Plata, where I began studying nitric oxide signaling. During this work, I contributed to the identification and functional characterization of the first nitric oxide synthase described in the plant kingdom.
My current research focuses on gasotransmitter signaling, particularly nitric oxide and its interaction with hydrogen sulfide in photosynthetic organisms. I investigate nitrogen metabolism and nitrate signaling using molecular, biochemical, and transcriptomic approaches, mainly in Arabidopsis thaliana and Marchantia polymorpha. A key part of my activity involves developing genetic biosensors and recombinant protein platforms to study signaling pathways with high spatial and temporal resolution. I lead and collaborate in nationally funded research projects, supervise undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, and maintain active international collaboration
In addition to my role at CONICET and IIB–UNMdP, I was recently incorporated as an Assistant Researcher at iBio, where I participate in interdisciplinary research initiatives. My work integrates fundamental research with the development of experimental tools to address open questions in plant signaling and nutrient responses
